abstract: >
  Interactive visualization of next-token prediction in GPT-style language models.
  Loads pretrained artifacts and runs forward passes to generate next-token
  predictions with probability distributions. Designed to illustrate core concepts of
  how GPT-style models work without the complexity of full transformer
  architectures.

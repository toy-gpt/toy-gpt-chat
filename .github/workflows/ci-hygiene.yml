# WHY-FILE: Validate repository hygiene and documentation builds.
# REQ: Any check that can be run locally MUST be available locally via pre-commit.
# REQ: CI MUST NOT introduce arbitrary rules that are not reproducible locally.
# OBS: CI validates only; it never edits files or deploys docs.

name: CI Hygiene

# WHY: Validate docs and repo metadata on PRs and pushes.
# OBS: This workflow validates only; it never deploys.

on:
  push:
    branches: [main] # WHY: Run when pushing to main branch.
  pull_request:
    branches: [main] # WHY: Run on pull requests targeting main branch.
  workflow_dispatch: # WHY: Allow manual triggering from Actions tab.

permissions: # WHY: Use least privileges required.
  contents: read

env:
  PYTHONUNBUFFERED: "1" # WHY: Real-time logging.
  PYTHONIOENCODING: "utf-8" # WHY: Ensure UTF-8 encoding for international characters.

jobs:
  ci:
    name: Repository checks and MkDocs build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # WHY: Linux environment matches most production deployments
    timeout-minutes: 30 # WHY: Prevent hanging jobs. If over time, it is likely stuck.

    steps:
      # ============================================================
      # ASSEMBLE: Get code and set up environment
      # ============================================================

      - name: A1) Checkout repository code
        # WHY: Needed to access files for checks.
        uses: actions/checkout@v6

      - name: A2) Run pre-commit (all files)
        # WHY: Single source of truth for locally runnable quality gates.
        # OBS: Fails if hooks would modify files; does not commit changes.
        id: precommit # WHY: Identify step for conditional follow-up.
        uses: pre-commit/action@v3.0.1
        with:
          extra_args: --all-files

      - name: A2f) If pre-commit failed, run it locally
        if: failure()
        run: |
          echo "## Pre-commit failed" >> "$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY"
          echo "Please run pre-commit locally and commit the resulting changes." >> "$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY"

      - name: A3) Install uv (with caching)
        uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v7
        with:
          enable-cache: true # WHY: Speed up installs on subsequent runs
          cache-dependency-glob: "uv.lock" # WHY: Only re-cache when dependencies change

      - name: A4) Install Python version 3.14
        run: uv python install 3.14

      - name: A5) Show tool versions
        run: |
          python --version
          uv --version

      - name: A6) Sync to install all dependencies
        run: uv sync --extra dev --extra docs --upgrade

      # ============================================================
      # === BASELINE CHECKS ===
      # ============================================================

      - name: B1) validate-pyproject (must be in pyproject.toml deps)
